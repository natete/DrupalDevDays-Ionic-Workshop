# Step 05 What to do next

We have a good prove of concept now, but there are a lot of things we can do to improve our application:

* Add a loading spinner while the requests are being resolved. The [Loading Controller](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/components/#loading) might be useful for this task.
* Add error handling to your http requests.
* Add an icon and spalsh image. Check the [documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/icon-splashscreen.html) to learn how to generate the different versions of each file.
* Learn about more [components](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/components/) and [plugins](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/) to add more features to your application.
* Learn about [Progressive Web Apps](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/resources/progressive-web-apps/) and how can you use them in your projects.
* **Keep learning and keep enjoying**
